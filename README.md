# Low-Cost-Platform-For-Robot-Learning
The goal of the project is to develop a low-cost platform targeted towards researchers and students for reinforcement learning research. Ultimately, the platform should enable users to develop and validate reinforcement learning algorithms with ease by providing an easy to use pipeline between simulations and physical experiments. The platform will be able to use either the software approach or the hardware approach (refer to Figure 1.) Additional features of the platform such as soft components (e.g. polymer soft actuator) are also considered. Both off-board and on-board options will be considered for the final design.
