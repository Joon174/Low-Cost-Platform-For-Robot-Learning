Used to test if the algorithm can render the environment and train properly. Render.\+py is a script used during T\+DD for training simple agents with in order to port the weights to the Raspberry Pi Model 4 for unit testing. Instances of D\+QN and P\+PO agents are present to illustrate the flexibilty of the program on differen types of agent architectures.
