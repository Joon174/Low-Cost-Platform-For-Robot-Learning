This repository contains the development and integration of the interface scripts between the agent and the robotic platform.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{About}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an emerging field for controlling robots in an advance manner. Although progress has been made in the field, the validation of RL algotihms becomes difficult due to the cost of the robotic hardware. As such, a low-\/cost platform is designed to ease the complexity for using expensive equipment and introduce an interface which is user friendly. The aim is to develop a low-\/cost platform targeted towards researchers and students for reinforcement learning research.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Prerequisites}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
